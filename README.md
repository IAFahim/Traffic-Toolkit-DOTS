## 🌟 Features
✔️ Built for Scale – DOTS powered architecture optimized to simulate thousands of vehicles efficiently!	

✔️ Waypoint Based Navigation – Vehicles follow dynamic paths 

✔️ Traffic Light System – Manages intersections in real time

✔️ Collision Avoidance – Prevents frontal crashes using raycasting

✔️ Editor Tools for Debugging – Visualize vehicle paths and collisions

## 🚗 How It Works
1️⃣ Vehicle Movement
- Vehicles follow waypoints dynamically
- Supports turning at intersections

2️⃣ Traffic Lights & Intersections
- Traffic signals control vehicle movement
- Vehicles wait for a green light before crossing

3️⃣ Collision Detection
- Uses raycasting for real time frontal collision prevention
- Vehicles adjust speed to avoid crashes
  
## 🛠 Debugging & Editor Tools
✅ Custom Waypoint Editor – Easily create & connect routes in the Scene

✅ Visualize Vehicle Paths – Shows real time planned vehicle path

✅ Collision Gizmos – See detection range in Scene View

✅ Select Vehicles Easily – Search by ID and focus on vehicles

## 🎯 Roadmap
🔄 AI Behavior Improvements – More realistic driving patterns

🌎 Better Asset Management – Load different car models & cities

🏎 Performance Optimizations – Faster processing for larger traffic networks
